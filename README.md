# buildings
NYC open data about buildings and building permits. 
This purpose of this project is to clean and transform data about building permits so that it is easier to query.
It will use Python, sqlalchemy and mysql.  
Initial analysis will be done from a .csv file download.  Subsequent work will use Socrata api to get live data.
